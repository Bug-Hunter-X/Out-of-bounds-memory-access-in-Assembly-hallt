This repository contains an example of an out-of-bounds memory access bug in Assembly and its solution. The bug is caused by accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of an array or buffer, potentially leading to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior. The solution demonstrates how to add proper bounds checking to prevent this issue. The bug and solution code are provided in separate files.
